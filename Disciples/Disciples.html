                Being a disciple of Christ is not just saying it, is acting like one.
                The nickname "Christians" was given for the first time on Antioch in reference to the people that act like Christ.
            </p>
            <p class="verse1">
                "And when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assambled<br>
                themselves with the Church, and taugh much people. <br>And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch"

                In Youth Vision group there are all the teenagers from 12 to 17 of The International Church of Christ
                in Tegucigalpa and even doe we are not all disciples we are a group that is together and that supports
                each other. We are constantly trying to do more disciples to God and to grow the relationship with
                each other. All people in Youth Vision are not disciples yet but still trying to get every one to get
                baptized, and then other generations will come to Youth Vision and our work is the same that the one
                right now.

            Disciples are less than a half in Youth Vision but there is people studying the Bible and we are doing
            all possible, just like mentioned before and on our Activities page, to get more people to the Lord's feet.

        <p class="content-p6">
            If you get interested in how to be part of this marvellous group, start the Bible studies and get to be a
            disciple of Christ and be recognized by others as a Christian, please contact us and we will give you
            help to know what Jesus did for you, but also effort and compromise is needed from your part.

        <p class="content-p7">
            And if you are outside of Honduras, don't worry, search "ICC" or "Church of Christ" and the name of your city
            and they can give you the information, help, and support needed.
