                Everyone uses Social Media almost everyday and know with
                the pandemic social media is used even more. Anyway, not every
                content is appropiate to see for all the youths that use these
                apps, so we have to to take actions as followers of Christ
                and fight against these innapropiate content with content.
                Instead of harming or influence others to take attitudes that
                don't honor God with the content that we upload, help others
                to get to know how much Christ loves each one of us and what
                he did for us.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p2">
                That is why we have an account on the most used Social Apps and
                we upload content that is different from the rest and that
                inspires others to follow God and his Holly Word. <br>
                <img src="Philippians4_13.jpeg" class="Verse1">
            </p>
            <p class="content-p3">
                Images like this one that share a scripture that take others
                to read this same verse in another version, share it to others
                or remember the comandments our Lord gave us. We see posts in
                whatevers social media alost everyday and they are so many that 
                when one makes us laugh for exmaple, we remember even if we are
                not using our phones or computers, so when you see posts
                with scriptures or testimonies from someone your brains store
                that what you saw an later you remember them. Remembering
                verses makes us grow in our relationship with God beacuse we
                are thinking of what it says and it help us talking others
                about Jesus, it gives us strength when fighting tempation, and
                seeing this type of post and just giving it a like or share it
                will make you too see more posts like this ones and you'll stop
                seeing, listening etc. things that will help you grow spiritually,
                that won't encourage you to do things that doesn't please God, and
                <b>you</b> will be following the word of God that says to do not love
                what is in this world and on this commandment are included all the fashion that don't give honor to God.
            </p>
            <p class="Verse2">
                "Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. <br> If any man love the world,<br>the love of the Father is not
                in him"
            </p>
            <p class="Verse2-1">
                1 John 2:15
            </p>
            <p class="content-p4">
                If you are interested in how to help fighting against fashion that displease God, ask yourself:
                Why don't I start know? Creating a profile is easy and fast, and you will help in spreading the word of the Lord
                that is one of his commandments but, the most important thing is that you will be giving him honor and obeying his
                word. Also it is not neccesary to make an account and start uploading verses, testimonies etc., just by little action
                on whatever social media were hundreds of people sees comments for exmaple you can share the gospel and the Holy Word of
                Our Savior and Lord, <br> <span class="Jesus">Jesus Christ</span>
